# ACME

**ACME (Automated Clause Mapping Engine)** expands the scope of differential testing for database management systems by introducing **SQL clause mappings** between traditional and emerging database engines. Even a small number of mappings can greatly improve testing coverage. Nowe we find, with the help of LLMs, these mappings can now be automatically generated (LLM component will be updated in the future).

This repository contains the **demonstration code for ACME**, showcasing its functionality with **QuestDB** and **PostgreSQL**.
